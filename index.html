            <p>
                My name is Kyle Stutts, but I prefer to be addressed by my middle name, Hunter. My mom has never even called my by my first
                name, unless I was up to no good, and then it was by my full name. I grew up living with my Mom and Grandma in South Austin 
                until I was about 7 years old. My Mom and I moved to Pflugerville, which is basically just North Austin, until I was about 16.
                Finally, we moved to Round Rock until I went to college at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Go Roadrunners!

            <p>
                I only attened UTSA for one year and moved back to Round Rock to attend Austin Community College to take some courses. I now
                live in Georgetown and currently attending the University of Texas at Austin for a certification. My hobbies include music and
                sports! I am a dedicated die hard fan of America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys, and the San Antonio Spurs. I'm also off and on learning
                to play the guitar, because I was always told it's never too late to learn!
